/**
* The interface definition for a PureMVC Notification.
*
* <P>
* PureMVC does not rely upon underlying event models such
* as the one provided with in AppKit or UIKit</P>
*
* <P>
* The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists
* to support event-driven communication between the
* application and the actors of the MVC triad.</P>
*
* <P>
* Notifications are not meant to be a replacement for Events
* in AppKit or UIKit. Generally, <code>IMediator</code> implementors
* place event listeners on their view components, which they
* then handle in the usual way. This may lead to the broadcast of <code>Notification</code>s to
* trigger <code>ICommand</code>s or to communicate with other <code>IMediators</code>. <code>IProxy</code> and <code>ICommand</code>
* instances communicate with each other and <code>IMediator</code>s
* by broadcasting <code>INotification</code>s.</P>
